Project 3A - File System Interpretation
CS 111 Winter 2021 - Xu

In this project, we will design and implement a program that will read, analyze, and summarize
the contents of an on-disk representation of a file system.
    -Primary: reinforce the basic file system concepts of directory objects, file objects, and free space.
    -Primary: reinforce the implemenation descriptions provided in the text and lectures.
    -Primary: gain experience researching, examining, interpreting and processing information 
    in complex binary data structures.
    -Primary: gain experience with examining interpreted and raw hex dumps of complex data 
    structures as a means of developing an understanding of those data structures.
    -Secondary: gain practical experience with typical on-disk file system data formats.

Deliverables:
    lab3a.c: Contains the source code for our program
    ext2_fs.h: The header file given in the project
    Makefile: Builds lab3a executable and supports 3 targets:
        default: Runs gcc to create a lab3a executable
        clean: Deletes all files created from Makefile 
        dist: Produces the tarbell for submission
    README: Information on the project
