Project 3A - File System Interpretation
CS 111 Winter 2021 - Xu

In this project, we will design and implement a program that will read, analyze, and summarize
the contents of an on-disk representation of a file system.
    -Primary: reinforce the basic file system concepts of directory objects, file objects, and free space.
    -Primary: reinforce the implemenation descriptions provided in the text and lectures.
    -Primary: gain experience researching, examining, interpreting and processing information 
    in complex binary data structures.
    -Primary: gain experience with examining interpreted and raw hex dumps of complex data 
    structures as a means of developing an understanding of those data structures.
    -Secondary: gain practical experience with typical on-disk file system data formats.

Deliverables:
lab3a.c which has the source code of our program
ext2_fs.h which is the header file given 
Makefile to build the program and the tarbell (utilizes default, dist, and clean)
